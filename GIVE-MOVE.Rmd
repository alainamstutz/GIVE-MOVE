# Estimation of "a" per-protocol effect for GIVE-MOVE (there are several) 

Based primarily on: 
Guidelines for estimating causal effects in pragmatic randomized trials by Murray et al.

Causal estimand of interest: The effect of receiving the assigned treatment strategies
= The effect of successfully receiving GRT-guided strategy in intervention and VL-guided strategy in control
= Estimation of a per-protocol effect for a point intervention

We estimated the per-protocol effect of GRT-guided strategy, which was defined as the effect of GRT-guided strategy if all the participants who were randomly assigned to the intervention group had received the GRT-guided strategy. The risk of VL failure may have differed between the participants who received GRT-guided strategy and those who were assigned to GRT-guided strategy but did not receive it; therefore, our analysis should adjust for the baseline covariates of the participants and sites.

Note: We assume a point treatment situation. However, we could also argue for a sustained intervention strategy (e.g. since no-one in control should have received GRT over the entire study period). Then, we would need to adjust for time-varying confounding over study period (using g-methods).

Define non-adherence to treatment strategy in each group:

Intervention group:
1) Participants not receiving a GRT although they were supposed to have one: 3 participants
2) Participants not having the decision visit within six months (24 weeks) after randomization: 26 participants
- of which LTFU: XXX ?
- otherwise: missing/delayed GRT (but that's already part of number 1?!) or missing/delayed visit?

Control group:
1) Participants receiving a GRT although they were not supposed to have one: 3 participants
2) Participants not receiving a VL although they were supposed to have one: 1 participant
3) Participants not having the decision visit within six months (24 weeks) after randomization: 10 participants
- of which LTFU: XXX ?
- otherwise: missing/delayed VL (that's already part of number 2?!)

Note: Not having a VL result within the 9-month window (and not having reached the primary endpoint before or at the 9-month visit (13 participants)) is already part of the primary endpoint/estimand (if it would not be part of primary causal estimand, then use multiple imputation or IPW for LTFU)

Define DAG: See slide in folder "DAG"

Define method used:
Because a point intervention is delivered at or close to the time of randomization, only covariates at or before the time of randomization can influence adherence to a point intervention. To validly estimate the per-protocol effect, baseline variables which predict adherence and are prognostic for the outcome need to be accounted for, either through direct adjustment or via an instrumental variable analysis.
Inverse probability and standardization allow calculation of absolute risks in the study population and preserve the marginal (unconditional) interpretation and are therefore preferable for direct adjustment. 
Other commonly used adjustment methods, like propensity score adjustment or matching or instrumental variable, typically make strong assumptions about no effect heterogeneity (rely on the assumption of effect homogeneity across levels of all covariates), among others, and do not easily yield unconditional absolute risks.

# Inverse Probability Weighting and adjusted/unadjusted PP model without weighting

We will estimate inverse probability weights to generate a pseudo population, in which covariates no longer predict adherence ("the adherents are made similar to the non-adherents" by upweighting those adherents that have similar characteristics as those non-adherent), allowing adherence to appear to be randomized with respect to the observed covariate distribution. So, in this pseudo-population everyone either adheres to treatment or not. 

We can do this manually (using logistic regression models to predict the probability (=propensity) of treatment and then calculate the (un)stabilized weights) or estimate the weights on the PP population using the ipw package: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ipw/index.html
The package entails functions to estimate the probability to receive the observed treatment, based on individual characteristics. "ipwpoint" function is the function for point treatment situations. 
It can calculate unstabilized and stabilized weights. Unstabilized weights are based on the inverse of the probability of receiving the observed treatment assignment, i.e. be adherent in the respective arm. Stabilized weights take into account the fact that the estimated probabilities used in the calculation of unstabilized weights might not be very accurate, especially when treatment assignment is highly imbalanced or when the estimated probabilities are close to zero. Stabilized weights aim to reduce the variability and potential instability caused by extreme probabilities. 
We will use the cluster-version of robust sandwich SE to correctly estimate the SE of the treatment effect estimate since there are multiple observations per participant (another option would be bootstrapping)

# print(vif_values)

## check the summary of the unstabilized weights:
round(summary(df_ipw2$usw), 3)
# Similarly, we can check the summary of the stabilized weights:
round(summary(df_ipw2$sw), 3)
# We can see that the mean of stabilized weights is 1, while it is 1.9 for unstabilized weights. For both unstabilized and stabilized weights, it seems there are no extreme weights. So, no truncation needed.

## check the distribution of the covariates by the treatment status on the pseudo population. The standardized mean difference (SMD) less than 0.10 is often recommended as a good covariate balancing (add ref, e.g. Zhongheng Zhang, Hwa Jung Kim, Guillaume Lonjon, Yibing Zhu, et al. Balance diagnostics after propensity score matching. Annals of translational medicine, 7(1), 2019.). To do this, now we will create a survey design using the weights:

# Design with unstabilized weight
design.unstab <- svydesign(ids = ~scrno, weights = ~usw, data = df_ipw2)
# Design with stabilized weight
design.stab <- svydesign(ids = ~scrno, weights = ~sw, data = df_ipw2)

# Then we will use the tableone package to see covariate balancing. We will do it for the unstabilized weights first:

# Covariates
covariates <- c("agegr_der","stsite_der2","regimen_der2",
                 "sex","scrvl",
                "whocur",
                  "wt",
                  "time_on_art_yrs", 
                  "time_on_curr_art_yrs" ,
                  "fathervit","mothervit", 
                  "travtim","travcost"
                , "travmod"
                 , "stsite" 
                )
# Table stratified by treatment status
tab.unstab <- svyCreateTableOne(vars = covariates, strata = "arm", data = design.unstab, test = F)
print(tab.unstab, smd = T)

tab.stab <- svyCreateTableOne(vars = covariates, strata = "arm", data = design.stab, test = F)
print(tab.stab, smd = T)

```

## As a "sensitivity" analysis (and for fun): add an instrumental variable analysis (even though assumptions probably do not hold)
We will use Two-stage least square (2SLS) with randomization as the instrumental variable and "adhering to the protocol" as the treatment variable.
In the first stage, the relation between treatment assignment and treatment adherence is estimated.
In the second stage, the effect of the GRT-strategy on the outcome is estimated, using the predicted values from the first stage as an independent variable in a logistic regression model.

```{r}
# Stage 1 of 2SLS // use entire dataset !
table(analysis$ppadh2,analysis$arm)
s1 <- glm(ppadh2 ~ arm 
          + agegr_der + stsite_der2 + regimen_der2 
          + sex + scrvl 
          + whocur 
          + wt 
          + time_on_art_yrs + time_on_curr_art_yrs 
          + fathervit + mothervit 
          + travtim + travcost 
          + travmod 
          + stsite
          , data = analysis, family = binomial("logit"))
analysis$ppadh.new <- NA
analysis$ppadh.new <- predict(s1, type = "response")

# In the second stage, we will fit the outcome model (the logistic regression) with the predicted treatment from the first stage and the confounders. We should use the robust sandwich SE to estimate the SE of the treatment effect correctly to account for the clustering effect of multiple observations per participant (Cameron AC, Miller DL. A practitioner's guide to cluster-robust inference. J Hum Resour. 2015;50(2):317-372.)
